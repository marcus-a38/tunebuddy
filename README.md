# TuneBuddy

### A small beginner application utilizing Apple Music's API. 

Disclaimer: 
This program is- under the GNU GPLv3 license- open-source, but requires accreditation and proper documentation. This program will not (initially) be intended for commercial or public use, and will be rather experimental, so please use any of the software at your own discretion. The license also clearly states that there is little to no liability or warranty.

### How it Works:

Using the Apple Music API, the program will fetch your music library. Optionally, you will be able to manipulate and insert custom information on specific albums and songs to fit personal preference. A neural network (utilizing tensorflow) will determine the song's mood, and depending on the user's daily mood, preferences, and desires, the program will curate a daily or temporary playlist.
